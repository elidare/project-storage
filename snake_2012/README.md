This was a project I made while studying Javascript at the courses in 2012.
The snake works on JS. Php was for saving results to a file and probably to some study server, too, but it is long gone now.
jQuery was included for ui-search through results, and I really suppose to delete this part.

However, I haven't changed a thing in the js script since 2012.
