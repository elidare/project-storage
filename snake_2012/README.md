This was a project I made while studying Javascript at the courses in 2012.
The snake works on JS. Php is for saving results to file (and probably to some study server, too).
jQuery was included for ui-search through results, and I really suppose to delete this part (or fix it somehow).

However, I haven't changed a thing in the js script since 2012.
